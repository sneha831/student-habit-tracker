# student-habit-tracker
# Overview
This is a small and simple personal project I created to gain more knowledge about building web apps using Streamlit.
The main idea of this project is to help students track their daily habits and understand how their routine may affect their mood and stress levels.

In this app, a student can enter:

Study hours

Sleep hours

Screen time

Mood

Stress level

All the data is saved in a CSV file and shown in a table with simple visualizations. I added bar charts and correlation plots to make the analysis easier and more meaningful.

# Why I Made This Project
I wanted to build something small but useful to improve my understanding of how web apps and data collection work.
Instead of downloading a ready-made dataset, I chose to create my own sample data. This helped me learn:

How to simulate realistic student habits

How to work with datetime, random values, and pandas in Python

How to prepare a dataset that fits my app's design

By generating my own dataset, I got better control over the format and structure — which made it easier to test and improve the app.

# Tools & Technologies Used
Python – For writing the core logic

Streamlit – To create the web app interface

Pandas – For data handling and analysis

Google Colab – To create and test the dataset

# What I Learned
This project helped me:

Build a basic UI using Streamlit

Take user input and save it to a CSV file

Read and update data dynamically

Create visual insights using charts

Understand how even simple tools can be powerful when used properly

It also gave me hands-on experience in creating a small end-to-end project — from data generation to app deployment.
Even though it's a beginner-level project, it was very helpful for learning and practicing real-world skills.
